# CodeClauseInternship_Blindness_detection
Blindness detection  using Machine learning in Python
In this project, we delve into the field of machine learning to develop a model for detecting blindness based on certain features. Early detection of blindness can lead to better medical intervention, and machine learning can assist in this process. The project is implemented using Python and the Jupyter Notebook environment.

Dataset:
The dataset for this project is obtained from Kaggle and contains information about various features related to blindness and associated medical conditions. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to ensure accurate analysis and model training.

Techniques and Algorithms:       
To achieve accurate blindness detection, we employ a range of techniques and algorithms, including:  
-->Data Preprocessing and Cleaning   
-->Feature Extraction   
-->Model Selection   
-->Model Training and Evaluation
